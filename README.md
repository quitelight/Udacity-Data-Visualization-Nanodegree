## Project 4 - Build a Data Story
For Story 1:
The Movies dataset was analyzed to understand anomalies in the data and the hidden insights.
A Ghost Deck along with an issue tree as a result of the analysis of insights has been created. Further to this, a final presentation that includes analysis of numerical variable distributions as well as the biases in the data was created.

For Story 2:
An economic indicators dataset from the World Bank was used to produce a Data Story.
